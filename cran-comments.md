## R CMD check results

## Reverse dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of JuliaCall
(https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep).
The summary generated by revdepcheck is at (https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep/README.md)
and (https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep/problems.md).
There are 7 downstream dependencies currently -- bigsimr, convexjlr, diffeqr, iai, knitr, phenofit, and RTIGER. We checked these 7 reverse dependencies, comparing R CMD check results across CRAN and dev versions of this package.

 * We saw 0 (new) problems. Only 1 note with convexjlr and diffeqr each, which are unrelated to JuliaCall package.
