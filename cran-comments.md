## Reverse dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of JuliaCall
(https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep).
The summary generated by revdepcheck is at (https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep/README.md)
and (https://github.com/Non-Contradiction/JuliaCall/tree/master/revdep/problems.md).
There are 7 downstream dependencies currently -- convexjlr, diffeqr, iai, knitr, phenofit, RTIGER, and tktdj12r.
